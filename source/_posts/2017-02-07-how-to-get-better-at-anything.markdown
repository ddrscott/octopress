## RTFM
{% img /images/rtfm-wtfm.jpg  400 387 'RTFM WTFM' %}

* WTFM, Write The Flip'n Manual
* Do a lightning talk about it :)

## Make it Fun
{% img /images/koala_trophy.jpg 'Surprised Koala Trophy' %}

* Gamification
* Trophy anyone?
* If it can't be made fun, make it fun.

## Practice
{% img /images/ive_practiced.jpg  "I've practiced a lot" %}

* Slowly with intent
* Pressure cycles: none, some, actual, intolerable.
* The practice of practice deserves its own talk.

## Better not good
{% img /images/good_to_better.jpg  "Good to Better Chart" %}

* Good is the killer of better.
* People tend to stop because good is unreachable.
* People tend to stop after they're good enough.
* If we aim to get better, we'll eventually be better than good.
* Progressive goals. OMG! I forgot goal setting!

## Learn, don't Memorize
{% img /images/one_does_not_memorize_pi.jpg  "One does not simply memorize PI" %}

* Learning is understanding
* Understanding is connecting the new thing to an old thing.
* Computers memorize. You're not a computer.

## Learn with others
{% img /images/google_hug.jpg "Google Hug" %}

* With the Internet you're never alone and always alone.
* Actually talk with people!

## Cheat
{% img /images/inspect_source.jpg  "One does not simply memorize PI" %}

* If you're not cheating, you're not trying.
* Reverse engineer the cheat, don't actually cheat!

## Vim Example
* **RTFM** - `:help`
* **WTFM** - Blogging, figure out other peoples problems :/
* **Practice** Wrote stuff that wasn't needed immediately, my own notes.
* **Don't Memorize** Vim has grammar like English. Oooh... Reconnection!
* **Learn with Others** - We have vim users, teach them (but don't let them know
    your only a 1/8th step ahead :o)
* **Cheat** Look at the source code to see how others do things

## What do you want to get better at next?!?
