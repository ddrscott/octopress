I found a plugin that is changing my Vim-tire life! This
[plugin](https://github.com/kana/submodes.vim) is so awesome it should be
built into default Vim. What does the [plugin](https://github.com/kana/submodes.vim)
do? It enables the creation of new submodes. Why would a person want *more* modes?!?
Isn't dealing with modes the main deterrent for new Vim users? Isn't Normal,
Insert, Command-line, Visual, Select, and Operator-pending enough? (Did I miss one?)
Let's try out a new submode and see what happens.
<!-- more -->

## Problem
Window commands are prefixed with `<C-w>`. Want to create a horizontal split?
Try `<C-w>s`, didn't mean to do that and want to do vertical split? `<C-w>q<C-w>v`.
Want to resize the vertical split `50<C-w>>`? Too wide? Narrow it with `5<C-w><`.
Move back to the other window? `<C-w>p` or `<C-w>w`.

Are your fingers getting tired? After I get the windows just right using default
mappings my fingers are crying for mercy.

Here's a short list of common default window commands:
```vim
" Change window focus
{n}<C-w>h   move cursor left  {n} window
{n}<C-w>l   move cursor right {n} window
{n}<C-w>j   move cursor down  {n} window
{n}<C-w>k   move cursor up    {n} window

" Move window
<C-w>H   move window far left
<C-w>L   move window far right
<C-w>J   move window far bottom
<C-w>K   move window far top

" Change size
{n}<C-w>+  increase height by {n} rows
{n}<C-w>-  decrease height by {n} rows
{n}<C-w><  decrease width by {n} columns
{n}<C-w>>  increase width by {n} columns
   <C-w>|  maximize width
   <C-w>_  maximize height
   <C-w>=  equalize sizes
```

For a comprehensive list of window commands try `:help windows.txt`.

## Solution A
The most common solution to window-command-itis is to map other keys to these
common actions so to include the `<C-w>` prefix.

From [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim/blob/3.0/.vimrc):
```vim
map <C-J> <C-W>j<C-W>_
map <C-K> <C-W>k<C-W>_
map <C-L> <C-W>l<C-W>_
map <C-H> <C-W>h<C-W>_
" Note: They go one extra by maximizing the height after entering the split.
```

From [Thoughbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/vim-splits-move-faster-and-more-naturally):
```vim
nnoremap <C-J> <C-W><C-J>
nnoremap <C-K> <C-W><C-K>
nnoremap <C-L> <C-W><C-L>
nnoremap <C-H> <C-W><C-H>
```

This has been the accepted solution for most, but it takes away so many
convenient keys. And in some cases, it even overrides default behaviour.
`<C-L>`, I miss you. `C-H`, isn't that also `<BS>`? Guess I won't be using
you either.

## Solution B - Submode to the Rescue
Install https://github.com/kana/submodes.vim. I consider it one of Japan's
national treasures along with ninjas and ramen. Unfortunately, Kana's example
use of submodes is a little underwhelming: undo/redo using `g-` and `g+`.
I agree with the author that using `g-` and `g+` is not convenient,
but the solution for that is simply `u` and `<C-R>`. I feel a better application
for a new submode is window management.

Back to solving the real problem, `<C-w>`. After installing the plugin please
add the following to your `$MYVIMRC`.

```vim
" A message will appear in the message line when you're in a submode
" and stay there until the mode has existed.
let g:submode_always_show_submode = 1

" We're taking over the default <C-w> setting. Don't worry we'll do
" our best to put back the default functionality.
call submode#enter_with('window', 'n', '', '<C-w>')

" Note: <C-c> will also get you out to the mode without this mapping.
" Note: <C-[> also behaves as <ESC>
call submode#leave_with('window', 'n', '', '<ESC>')

" Go through every letter
for key in ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m',
\           'n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z',
\           '=','_','|','+','-','<','>']
  " maps lowercase, uppercase and <C-key>
  call submode#map('window', 'n', '', key, '<C-w>' . key)
  call submode#map('window', 'n', '', toupper(key), '<C-w>' . toupper(key))
  call submode#map('window', 'n', '', '<C-' . key . '>', '<C-w>' . '<C-'.key . '>')
endfor
" Go through symbols
for key in ['=','_','|','+','-','<','>']
  call submode#map('window', 'n', '', key, '<C-w>' . key)
endfor
```

After `:source $MYVIMRC`, you'll have a glorious new submode in Vim.
I named it *window* mode. Can you guess how to get into *window* mode?
`<C-w>`, the normal prefix used to do any `wincmd`. If this is too drastic, feel
free to change line #7 to something else. Just replace `<C-w>` with a different
normal mapping.

Let's give it a test drive.
{% img featured /images/window-submode.gif 1142 719 'window mode in action' %}

I know you can't see what keys on pressing, but I guarantee I only pressed
`<C-w>` once. I also didn't have to remember any new key bindings. The
hesitation in the demo is the resistance to hitting `<C-w>` every time, which
I'll get over soon enough.

## Bonus Mappings
But wait there's more! In case I haven't provided enough tips for one post,
here's the overrides I have in `$MYVIMRC` to make windowing even better.

```vim
" I don't like <C-w>q, <C-w>c won't exit Vim when it's the last window.
call submode#map('window', 'n', '', 'q', '<C-w>c')
call submode#map('window', 'n', '', '<C-q>', '<C-w>c')

" <lowercase-pipe> sets the width to 80 columns, pipe (<S-\>) by default
" maximizes the width.
call submode#map('window', 'n', '', '\', ':vertical resize 80<CR>')

" Resize faster
call submode#map('window', 'n', '', '+', '3<C-w>+')
call submode#map('window', 'n', '', '-', '3<C-w>-')
call submode#map('window', 'n', '', '<', '10<C-w><')
call submode#map('window', 'n', '', '>', '10<C-w>>')
```

## Closing
While learning this new way of windowing, there have been a few negatives:

1. I forget that I'm in window mode and get disoriented when I think I'm moving
   the cursor within a buffer, but it jumps around to other splits.

2. For one off window commands, I have to hit an extra key to get out of window
   mode or wait for the timeout.

3. When I use some one else's computer, I'm useless.

I think most of these annoyances will go away with time, and the benefits
overtime in keystroke savings are non-trivial. As for #3, regardless of submodes,
the brain freeze will never go away, because no one thinks as strangely as me,
and that's a Good Thingâ„¢.

So let me know what you think. Am I crazy or is this the next big thing? Hit me
up in the comments! Thanks for reading!

of this awesomeness would be possible without https://github.com/kana/vim-submode. She
makes some totally sweet plug-ins. Check out her stuff. You won't regret!
