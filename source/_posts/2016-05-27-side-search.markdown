The `quickfix` feature is nice, but it doesn't give enough context around the
search term that leads to use `ag` from terminal and switch back and forth
between programs. I do this search dance every day and I've had it! There must
be better way!

## Problem
{% img featured /images/side-search-a.png 1280 1009 'Quickfix for help' %}
Look at the `quickfix` window above. It spends most of its space showing the file name
of the hit, then the remainder is spent on text around it. In projects using 
[Rails Engines](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) with deeply nested
directory structures, this often leaves me with just a bunch of paths in the `quickfix`.


## Solution A - The Unix Way

Some may argue Vim isn't suppose to do search. Vim rightly delegates to the
[Unix philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html) by
allowing an external program do its searching. Let's try that for this
solution using `grep`, `ack`, and `ag`.

{% img featured /images/side-search-compare.png 1280 822 'grep vs ack vs ag' %}

We've run the 3 separate programs (normally, I would only use `ag`) then
browse the results to see if there's an interesting file. At this point I start
using my handy-dandy mouse to scroll around, precisely highlight the path of
interest, copy, and type `vim <Paste>`. Intuitive? Yes. Fast? No!

Maybe I should use `tmux` or `screen` so I don't need to mouse around, but
trying to select a path is still pretty slow for me and requires more cognitive
load than I have patience for. After all, I'm trying to concentrate on a
refactor or something, not how to open a bunch of files. Should I practice more?
Yes. Will I? No!

We're going to use `ag` from now on, since it's faster than `ack`, and has
prettier output than `grep`. I really really really tried to get `grep` to
output for humans, but couldn't figure it out.


## Solution B - Vim without Quickfix

Let Vim do some work for us.

```
vim `ag --ignore=\*.{css,scss} -l help` +'/help'
```

What's that?!? Open Vim passing the result of `ag` command. `ag` is run with
some file exclusions, `-l` only file names, and `help` is the search term.
`+'/help'` tells Vim to immediately start searching for 'help'.

After all that, Vim should have started with a bunch of buffers. View them with
`:ls`. Take notice of the buffer numbers to see how many files were found. Use
`n` and `N` to jump through search matches in the file. Use `:bn` to go to the
next buffer and start hitting `n` again to cycle through the changes. If the
number of files is small enough, you may be able to use `:ball` to open every
buffer in its own window.

Thats a lot of work to jump through changes. Good thing the `quickfix` exists.

## Solution C - Quickfix

This is here for posterity. `quickfix` DOES make cycling through changes easier
than Solution B, but as I stated in the intro, it doesn't give the context that
we want.

[Thoughtbot has a pretty good article](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/faster-grepping-in-vim)
about how to setup Vim to use `ag`. Once you do that, you can `:grep help` to
get the following output:

{% img featured /images/side-search-a.png 1280 1009 'Quickfix for help' %}

Use `:cnext`, `:cprev`, `:cfirst`, `:clast` to go to next, previous, first, and
last `quickfix` result respectively. Map those to keys to make it easier to
navigate.

```
nnoremap [q :cprev<CR>
nnoremap ]q :cnext<CR>
nnoremap [Q :cfirst<CR>
nnoremap ]Q :clast<CR>
```

Get more help about `quickfix` using `:help quickfix`. Cry after realizing
even `:help quickfix` can't show more context. I'll be here when you're done.

## Solution D - Side Search Plugin

So how do we get the best of both worlds? How do we enter the land of a thousand
wives/husbands? How do we get `ag` output and quick navigation? For me, it
was writing a plugin in. For you it's using it. https://github.com/ddrscott/vim-side-search

After installing the plugin using your favorite package manager, you'll have
access to the following functionality:

{% img featured /images/side-search-demo-b.gif 1169 631 'Side Search Demo' %}

Things to notice:

  - `ag` output is in a buffer with additional syntax highlighting!
  - `n` and `N` used to jump to matches. Regular Vim navigation works, too!
  - `<CR>` and `<C-w><CR>` used to open change and jump to change!
  - Number of matches shown in the buffer name!
  - I use too many exclamation points!!!

The plugin's `README` has more details.

## Closing

I've been using this plugin ever since its inception and don't know where I'd
be without it. It gets some inspiration from [fugitive's](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
`:Gstatus` mode/buffer, and I wish there were more plugins that added
functionality from `stdout` instead of transforming it into a different format. Unix
tools makers spend a lot of time thinking about the output. Let's use it to our
advantage.

I've learn a lot creating this plugin and plan to write about it in a future post.
