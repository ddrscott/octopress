This was a lightening talk given to the office about ANSI Escape Codes. Most of
the time, all 5 minutes of it, was spent explaining the code snippets.

## What is an ANSI code?

ANSI Escape Codes are a nearly universal means of embedding display options in
computer terminals.

`\e[` is how to tell the terminal we're giving it a command instead just
outputting text. 

What does that mean?!? Let the examples do the talking.

## Color Examples

```bash
echo -e "\e[2J\e[32m It's not easy being green \e[0m"
echo -e "\e[2J\e[31m Apples are red  \e[0m"
```

```ruby
(30..37).each{|i| puts "i: \e[#{i}m #{i} \e[0m"}
```

## Position Examples

```ruby
x=`tput cols`.to_i
y=`tput lines`.to_i
loop do
  print "\e[s" # Save current cursor position
  print "\e[#{rand(y)};#{rand(x)}H"  # move to row/column
  print "ðŸ’©"    # print POOP!
  print "\e[u" # restore position
  sleep(rand)
end
```

```bash
# Ruby oneliner troll
ruby -e 'x=`tput cols`.to_i; y=`tput lines`.to_i; loop {print "\e[s\e[#{rand(y)};#{rand(x)}HðŸ’©\e[u"; sleep(rand)}'
```
